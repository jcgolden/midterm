		<h1>What They Don't Tell You About Being Independent in 2019</h1>

		<p>If you’ve been a part of music in the past 10 years, the bright-eyed pitch for independence is a familiar refrain: DAWs and DSPs opened the floodgates, SoundCloud rappers are signing huge deals with songs mixed on Bluetooth speakers—in short, you don’t need a label to succeed. </p>
			<p>There’s some truth to it—but our current definition of an “independent musician” is murky at best. Does it mean you own all your masters and distribution? Or does independence apply to artists signed to independent labels? What about joint ventures? What about artists using a Renaissance playbook, funded by a patron that can support them in lieu of a label?  </p>
			<p>Before looking forward, we’d do well to start by looking back. A decade before the digital revolution cut the music industry off at the knees, independent music had another day in the sun. Until recently, the indie heyday was widely recognized as the grunge and indie rock wave of the ’90s—bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam proved that “alternative music” could be commercially successful without sacrificing its edge. Indie labels like Sub Pop and ANTI- outflanked the majors and made space for challenging, unique music. The revolution was short-lived, however, and major labels controlled about 72% of industry revenue by 2005.  </p>
			<p>Fast forward to today and the major label market share remains around 70%. Direct to artist revenue is a point of growth, however, and the barrier to entry has never been lower, and with this newly accessible music industry comes a wealth of questions. Chief among them is this: is a major label deal still a metric for success?</p>
			<p>There’s no answer to the question, just an infinite number of opinions. So we decided to gather the opinions of those who might have a better idea than most: independent labels and musicians. In this brave new world of streaming services, merch bundles, and brand partnerships, how can a small artist survive? And what is/isn’t real about the lifestyle and business of an independent artist/label?</p>

		<h3>It's much more complicated than indie vs. major.</h3>

			<p>"A lot of our favorite 'independent' artists are secretly signed to major label deals. A lot of unsigned artists are financially supported or invested in by third parties, or managers with a ton of capital. A lot of times I hear this binary understanding of 'majors give you a big bag but you sign away all your rights' and 'indies don't give you any money up front but you keep your masters.' Neither of those is particularly true.</p>
			<p>"Some of the big indies have a ton of money to invest in developing artists, and sometimes artists sign super friendly deals with majors where they don't necessarily sign away their masters forever. A lot of the big indies are distributed by major-owner distributors. Some artists don't need labels, some do, or at least can really benefit in their career from it. The one thing I can say for sure, is this indie/major binary isn't real—there's a whole world of nuance in the types of deals artists sign and the way artists' music is treated by their label. </p>
			<p>"One consistent experience is that majors really have access to commercial radio that indies haven't had historically. But even that's changed. A lot of the biggest radio tracks of the last few years have come from independent labels. And conversely, some of the biggest artists have succeeded without any radio support at all." - Dean Bein, True Panther Sounds</p>
			<p>"I personally think signing a huge deal can sometimes be rooted in an archaic idea of success. It has its benefits for certain artists and I can appreciate that, but for people like me who are trying to push boundaries and have a really specific vision in mind, sometimes having a business partner with a lot of control over your creative can have detrimental effects. I don't want to create anything watered down or something that isn't completely true to myself. I think the main advice I would offer is know the value of you and your art—labels need you more than you need them. With a ton of hard work and good people to help you navigate, it's very possible to be a successful independent artist with a good living, without the constraints of a traditional label. The internet provides that opportunity to be super connected to listeners, and also to collaborators! The world is truly your oyster as an indie musician." - Raveena, artist</p>

			<p>"Sometimes the artists on b4 are so new that I find myself helping them build a team, from suggesting publicists to directors, producers to management. This also means working on my relationship with artists so they can trust my ideas. During so many of my first meetings with artists they tell me, 'I have this idea but no one to help execute it.' Surround yourself with other creative, driven people; be open to collaborating with others, listen to feedback, and be patient." - Briana Cheng, founder b4 Sounds / A&R at 4AD</p>
			<p>"You have to be assetive and clear-headed in your own vision to end up with art that is completely unique, and it takes an immense amount of communication and patience making the vision that lives inside of your head. Knowing and then asserting my vision is something I learned how to do over time, and the art of communicating that to collaborators is still something I am refining every day. No one you collaborate with—from studio musicians, to producers, designers, directors, hair/makeup—knows the universe that your music and art belongs in better than yourself. Those people cannot create your universe for you, they can only help elevate it with their expertise." - Raveena, artist </p>
			<p>"I've experienced certain artists who think that to be truly independent they have to do literally everything when it comes to the creation of the music. Writing, engineering, producing, mixing and sometimes even mastering. It's like a Prince myth: 'Well Prince did it all, so I should too in order to be a real artist.' I really disagree with that. I think a successful independent artist is like a successful architect. An architect isn't in the building laying plumbing down, they put together the right team to execute their larger vision. To not do everything doesn't mean you are suddenly a major label pop star puppet-mastered by profit-driven overlords. It means you're focused on making the best possible version of your work, and trusting the right people to share that vision with the world. The independent artist has confidence in their overarching story and vision but has the confidence to share the responsibility of execution." - Dean Bein, True Panther Sounds</p>
			<p>"Independence doesn't mean being independent of a team, and artists doing everything on their own. It’s always great to work with an artist that is hands on with all aspects of their work, but it’s very important to have a team that they can work with that will help execute ideas. One of the artists that we work with that is a great example of this is Knox Fortune—he writes and produces all of his music, and he also creates the artwork for his singles, albums, and promo materials. But he also has a tight network of photographers and videographers that he collaborates with to help bring his vision to life. It’s all about finding the puzzle pieces that fit into your work and creative vision." - Mike Kadziulis, Haight Brand</p>
